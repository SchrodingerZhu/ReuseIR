# ReuseIR Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for ReuseIR. The documentation uses 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is based on the template used by MLIR.

> [!CAUTION]
> The template contains stuff that is no longer supported by the latest Hugo
> release, and it's recommended to build the documentation with Hugo version
> 0.119.0.

After installing Hugo, you can start a local server that hosts the
documentation via the following command:

```bash
hugo server
```
